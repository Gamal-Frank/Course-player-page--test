E-Learning Platform UI - Technical Assessment

This repository contains a collection of React components developed as part of a front-end developer technical assessment. The project focuses on building a pixel-perfect, responsive user interface for a modern e-learning platform based on provided design mockups.

The primary goal was to demonstrate proficiency in creating high-quality, interactive, and reusable UI components using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

‚ú® Key Features

This project implements several key UI sections of an online course page:

Interactive Video Player: A custom video player component that shows a thumbnail initially and loads the video embed upon user interaction.

Dynamic Course Sidebar: An accordion-style curriculum viewer that displays course sections and lessons, including progress indicators and locked content states.

Responsive Progress Bar: A unique student progress bar that visualizes completion percentage with user avatars.

Data Display Components: Clean, icon-driven lists for displaying course metadata like duration, lessons, and enrollment numbers.

Popup Modals:

A Leaderboard popup displaying student rankings with a motivational message.

An Exam/Quiz interface designed for mobile.

An "Ask a Question" popup that persists user input within the same session using sessionStorage.

Mobile-First Responsive Navigation: The desktop social sharing icons are replaced by a functional tab bar on mobile screens for navigating to different sections of the page (Curriculum, Comments, etc.).

Pixel-Perfect Styling: Meticulous attention to detail to match the provided designs, including spacing, colors, shadows, and typography.
